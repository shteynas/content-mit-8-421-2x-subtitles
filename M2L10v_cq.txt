OK, and this is about hyperfine structure.
The question is hydrogen, in the ground state, has four states.
Because the electron can has a spin up and down
and the proton has a spin up and down, and two by two,
two times two is four.
So we're talking about multiplicity of four.
And I'm asking you
know about the limits of high and low fields,
first, at high fields and at low fields.
And the question is, what are the
magnetic moments of those hyperfine states.
We neglect the nuclear magnetron
compared to the Bohr magnetron.
So, what are the magnetic moments
of those hyperfine states in units of the Bohr magnetron.
