Today, we start with single electron atom,
with a hydrogen atom, and I cannot resist to start with
some quotes from Dan Kleppner, who, I sometimes call Mr.
Hydrogen, so there is a beautiful piece of writing
in the Reference Frame in Physics Today,
The Yin and Yang of Hydrogen. I mean,
those of you who know Dan Kleppner know that he's always
said, hydrogen is the only atom he wants to work
with.
Other atoms are too complicated.
And he studied-- actually hydrogen
was, he did a little bit on alkali atom of course,
but hydrogen was really the central part
of his scientific work.
He studied Rydberg states in hydrogen,
or Bose-Einstein Condensation in hydrogen.
And this column in Physics Today, I
mean he talks both the yin and yang,
the simplicity of hydrogen, it's the simplest atom.
But if you want to work with hydrogen, you need vacuum UV.
Because the step from the 1s to the 2p transition
is Lyman-alpha, is vacuum UV, at 121 nanometer.
So it's simple, but challenging.
And hydrogen is the most pristine atom.
but for those of you who Bose-Einstein Condensation,
it's the hardest atom to Bose condense.
Because the physical properties of hydrogen--
it's simple in its structure-- but the properties of hydrogen,
in particular, the coalition core section,
which is important for evaporative cooling,
is very, very unfavorable.
So that's why he talks about the yin and the yang of hydrogen.
Let me show you the first sentence of this paper,
of this Reference Frame.
Well, why don't we read it together.
It tributes to hydrogen, it tributes to famous people.
Viki Weisskopf was on the faculty at MIT.
I make him, but he was already retired at this point,
but Dan Kleppner interacted with him.
And you see the first quote, "To understand hydrogen
is to understand all of physics!"
Well, it simply, it's says that, if you understand
some of this paradigmatic systems in physics,
you understand all the physics.
I would actually say, well, you really
have to understand the harmonic oscillator,
the two-level system, and hydrogen, and maybe
a little bit about three-level systems.
But if you understand, really, those simple systems-- they're
not so simple-- but if you understand
those so-called simple systems very well, in all
its glorious detail, then you really
understood, maybe not all of physics,
but a hell of a lot of physics.
And this quote goes on that, to understand hydrogen is
to understand all of physics.
But then Viki Weisskopf said, well,
I wish I had understood all of hydrogen.
And this is sort of Dan's, Dan Kleppner's wise words,
"For me, hydrogen holds an almost mystical attraction,
possibly because I am among the small band of physicists
who actually confront it more or less daily."
So, that's what we're starting out now,
to talk about hydrogen. I know that a discussion
of the hydrogen atom, the solution of the Schrodinger
equation of the hydrogen atom isn't in all quantum mechanics
textbooks, I'm not doing it here.
I rather want to sort of give you
a few insightful comments about the structure of hydrogen,
some scaling of length scales and energy levels,
because this is something we need later in the course.
So in other words, I want to highlight things which are often
not emphasized in the textbooks.
