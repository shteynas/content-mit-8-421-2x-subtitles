The Lamb shift is merely due to the fact
that if you have an atom consisting
of an electronic coulomb field in proton,
this is not a complete description.
The atom lives in a vacuum and the vacuum
is filled with electromagnetic waves.
So what we have to include for an accurate
description of atomic level structure
is the coupling of the atomic system
of the electron to all the modes of the electromagnetic field.
And this is radiation.
We will talk about the quantized electromagnetic field later.
At this point I could introduce you
to a simple model, fairly accurate model,
of the Lamb shift by simply assuming--
and that's what we did on Friday-- that we have
fluctuating electric fields.
Those was fluctuating electric field shake, accelerate,
the electron.
And the electron performs some oscillatory motion.
And this oscillatory motion leads to an over reaching
of the coulomb potential.
And similarly, what we saw for the Darwin term,
this averaging of the coulomb potential
takes away the singularity of the coulomb potential.
And therefore, lowers the binding energy of the electron.

So today I want to just say a few more words about the result
we derived.
And then we have done what happens
to an electron in a coulomb field plus radiation.
The next thing is then to discuss is then hyperfine structure.

So let me first make one comment.
When we integrated over all modes
of the electromagnetic spectrum, we needed an upper cut off
and a lower cut off due to logarithmic singularities.
Eventually an upper cut off, yes.
At relativistic, the last mass of the electron
we have to cut off things.
I just want to say one more word about the lower cut off.
I suggested as a cut off the orbital frequency
of the electron.
So the justification for that is the following.
The electron, the free electron-- the free electron,
when it's driven, has an amplitude
which is 1 over the frequency squared.
So if you drive it slower and slower,
its amplitude increases because it has more time
to go in one direction.
So this divergence at low frequency, of course,
happens only for the free system.
When you have a bound system like a harmonic oscillator
and you drive it at lower and lower frequency,
the response converges to a constant
and not to a 1 over drive frequency squared singularity.
So therefore, when we reach the--
when the drive frequencies on the order
of the-- oscillatory frequency of the bound system,
the behavior changes.
So we mimic this with an effective cut off because what
you want to get rid of is a singularity.
But in reality, of course, it should approach a constant
at low frequency.
And that is essentially the physics of the AC and then
the DC Stark effect.
So that was the rationale for the cut off.

And let me just annotate here.
And let's say for a free particle
we had the situation that the amplitude was proportional to 1
over the drive frequency, whereas for bound particle
s mu should approach a constant for low frequencies.
