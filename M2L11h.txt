I want to add three points to the discussion.
You can also see at this point we have really
understand the AC Stark shift theory as you find it
in generic quantum mechanics textbooks.
And now I want to give you a little bit of sort
off extra insight based on my knowledge of atomic physics.
So there are three points I would like to discuss here.
The first one is the relation to dressed to the dressed atom
picture.
The second one is, I want to parametrize the results
for the polarized ability using the concept of oscillator
strengths.
And thirdly, I want to tell you how
you can already at this point take our result for the AC
polarized ability and calculate how do atoms absorb light?
And what is the disperse of phase shift,
which atoms generate when they're exposed to light.
Or, in other words, I want to show you
that based on this simple result,
we have pretty much already all the information we need
to understand how absorption imaging and dispersive
imaging is done in the laboratory.
Let's start with number one, the relation to the dressed atom.
So what I want to show you now is, that the result
we obtained in time-dependant perturbation theory,
we could've actually obtained in time-independent perturbation
theory by not using the coherent electric field, which
oscillates, but just assuming that they're stationary Fock
states or photons.
And this is actually the dressed atom picture.
I know I'm throwing now a lot of sort of lingo at you.
It's actually very, very trivial.
But I want to show you that you've
a result where if you just open your eyes
you see actually the dressed atom shining through.
So what we had is, we had an energy shift here,
which was-- let me just summarize what we've derived.
It was this result with a polarized ability,
which we derived.
And let me rewrite the result from above.

So this is why I make the remark about the averaging
of the electric field.
If you combine it with, as you will see,
Rabi frequencies and dressed atom picture,
you meet the amplitude of the electric field.
And formulated in the amplitude of the electric field,
you have one quarter.
And this is not a mistake.
And you can really trace it down to the time
average of the course in term.
OK.
So this is now-- I'm really copying from the previous page.
We had the difference frequency between state one and state
two.
So I'm simply assuming we couple two states now in S
and P state.
If you want, we have a matrix element,
which is the matrix element of the position
operator, Z, between state one and state two squared.
We have an energy denominator, which was this one.
And we have-- so I'm just rewriting the previous result.
But now, I usually hate matrix elements
when they appear in a creation.
I mean, who knows matrix elements.
What is the relevant thing when we
couple two different states is the Rabi frequency.
Frequency units is what we want.
So therefore, I've prepared the formula
that I can take the matrix element
with the electric field.
And this is nothing else than the Rabi frequency squared.
Or actually, one is measured in energy units.
The other is frequency units, or there's an H plus squared.
So therefore, I've now written this result
in what I think is a more physically insightful way
by explicitly identifying the Rabi frequency with [INAUDIBLE]
and excited state.
And I also want to separate-- I want
to introduce the detuning of the time-dependent oscillating
electric field from resonance.

And then I obtain this result.
Doesn't it look so much simpler than what we had before?
And it has a lot of physics we can discuss now.
One over delta is sort of-- it's like an AC Stark effect
in one limit.
It's a far-off resonate case or of an optical trapping
potential.
So this formula that has a lot of insight,
which I want to provide now.
The second part-- I give you the name
and the interpretation will become obvious in the moment--
is the important bloch-siegert shift.
It is the AC Stark shift due to the count of rotating term.
So what I'm motivating here is-- just don't get confused.
What I write down is very simple.
And I sometimes use advanced language for those of you
who you have heard those passwords.
But what I really mean is-- what I want to discuss
and for you to follow are the simple steps we do here.
So anyway, what I've just done is
I've rewritten the result from the previous page,
but just introducing what I suggest as more
physically appealing symbols.
And now I want to remind you that this result for the AC
Stark effect, doesn't it look very
similar not to result to the standard result
of time-independent perturbation theory?

And, of course, you remember that
in time-independent perturbation theory,
you get an energy shift, which is
the square of a matrix element divided by detuning.

So it seems when we inspect our result for the AC Stark
effect, which came from time-dependent perturbation
theory, that this result here has actually-- if you map it
on time-dependent-- independent theory,
if has two terms, both coupled by the Rabi frequency.
But one has a detuning of delta and the other
has a detuning of minus 2 omega minus delta.
So it seems that the result for the AC Stark shift
can be completely understood by--
and a mixture of not one, but two different states
with different detunings.
And this is exactly what we will do in 8422 in the crest atom
picture when we have quantized the electromagnetic field.
In other words, we have photons.
Because then what we have is the following.
We have the ground state with N photons in gamma.
Well, there are sort of N quanti in this use than N photons.
But what we can do is we can now have one quantum of excitation
with the atom and N minus 1 photons.
So it's almost like absorbing a photon.
And this state has a detuning of delta.

But then we can also consider an excited state.
In other words, here we connect to the excited state
by absorbing a photon, but we can also
talk about it more and later.
We can also connect to the excited state
by emitting a photon.

So this state has now not one quanta excitation.
It's three quanta of excitation, one in the atom
and two in the photon.
So therefore, it's detuning-- it's now much, much larger.
Actually, if we're on resonant own,
the detuning would be just 2 omega.
But if you are detuned there is the delta.
So in other words, we can just say,
if we would do time-independent--
I'm not doing it here.
And I leave kind of all the beauty
to when we discuss the dressed atom picture
in it's full-fleshed version.
But all I'm telling you is that the result for the AC Stark
shift looks like time-independent perturbation
theory with those two detunings.
And I'm now offering you the physical picture behind it
by saying, look.
When we have the ground state with N photons
and we have those two other states,
they have exactly the detuning, which our result suggests.
And yes, indeed.
If you look at the manifold of those three states
and we would simply do time-independent perturbation
theory, we would find exactly the same frequency shift
to AC Stark shift as we just obtained
in a time-dependent picture.
So in other words, what I'm telling you is there
are two ways to obtain the AC Stark shift.
One is, you do time-dependent perturbation theory,
assume an oscillating electric field.
And that would mean in the quantized language
you assume the electromagnetic field is in a coherent state.
Alternatively, you can quantize the electric field
and introduce Fock states.
And then, because Fock states are time-independent,
then these are the eigenstates of the electromagnetic field
in a cavity.
And now you obtain the same atomic level
shift in time-independent perturbation theory.
So in other words, we can have photon number states
and do time-independent perturbation theory,
or alternatively, we can use the same classical electric field,
which means we have a classical electric field.
And then we can treat it in time-dependent.

All of the textbooks generally use the letter approach
because it uses a seemingly classic electric field.
But I can tell you I strongly prefer the first approach,
because in the first approach you've no problems whatsoever,
but is a time-dependent wave function.
What is an energy level shift when you have a driven system?

In a time-independent way everything just
is simple and right there in a simple way.
