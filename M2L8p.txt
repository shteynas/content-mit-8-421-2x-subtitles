So we have two effects now.
We have the volume effect, which is the stronger, the bigger
and the heavier the nucleus is.
So it's largest for heavy nuclei.
And the mass effect or the effective mass effect
is of course largest for the lightest
nuclei, with the extreme example of positronium.

Any questions?
What sort of energy scales are consistent with the volume
factor?
What energy is--
Is that comparable?
No, let's estimate it.
You're working with rubidium.
What is the isotope shift in rubidium between 85 and 87?
So many people worked with rubidium.
What is the difference in transition frequency
between rubidium 85 and 87?
[INAUDIBLE]
It's much more than gigahertz.
You really have to tune your laser.
I think if you look at a vapor cell,
you will never accidentally see rubidium 85 flying.
And for the mass effect, we said--
So then they would be comparable.
The mass effect is easy to estimate
because the mass convection is one part in a few thousand.
So that would mean on the order of 10
to the 10 hertz, 10 gigahertz.
So the volume effect, it really depends.
It's tiny for light elements.
Rubidium is already heavy.
So right now, I would say they're comparable.
But since it's of interest, I will give you
more accurate numbers on Wednesday.
Any the other questions?
Yes.
Can you explain the graph on the previous page,
how the lines are joined up?
The potential?
Yes.
Yeah, so what happens is-- so if we're being cryptic,
this is the charge distribution.
And what I'm doing now is I'm solving Laplace equation.
I'm solving Laplace's equation.
I'm indicating from r equals infinity.
And as long as I'm outside the charge radius,
I get the 1 over r Coulomb potential.
But the moment I hit the surface of the nucleus,
I continue to indicate Laplace's equation.
But what is now inside is a smaller and smaller charge.
So therefore, I don't-- I can also say I use a form
of Gauss's law.
So I'm therefore not continuing on the 1 over r.
And if you look at Jackson or if you look at maybe a piece
that you have solved, the 1 over r potential
becomes now a parabola.
And so what I wanted of indicate here
is once you hit the surface of the nucleus,
you're not continuing on the one over r trajectory.
You have in a way which is continuous and has
a continuous derivative, you have to fit in a parabola.
And for the heavier nucleus, this
leads us to this potential.
And whereas for the lighter nucleus,
the potential is deeper.
And that explains why the binding
energy for heavier nuclei is smaller
than for lighter nuclei.
Yes.
So for the other orbitals, [INAUDIBLE] exactly
0 or negative [INAUDIBLE]?

OK, for the other orbitals, what we have to do
is-- and actually, you have an homework assignment
to do it for hydrogen and the proton--
you take the difference between the actual potential
and the Coulomb potential.
So you take the difference.
And the difference is your perturbation operator
for the finite size of the nucleus.
And now you take this perturbation operator
between your wave function and calculate the lowest order
of the expectation value.
For the S electron, you can immediately
factor out the probability for the electron at S equals 0.
But as we discussed, if you have orbital angular momentun--
let me just scribble it down here--
the wave function is proportional to r to the L.
The wave function is exactly 0 only at r equals 0.
And then it slowly grows.
So therefore, given the finite size or the nucleus,
you will get a tiny, an absolutely tiny effect
if you indicate a wave function r
to the L over your perturbation operator.
So it's not mathematically 0.
But for all practical purposes, it vanishes.
Nancy.
For the different UPI, for example, in the video,
is [INAUDIBLE] affecting anything?
Or is it making [INAUDIBLE] also important in these isotopes?
Because the nuclear structure would
be different for both of them if they have
different [INAUDIBLE].
Oh, yeah.
When we talk isotope effects, I was
talking about the isotope effects of mass and volume.
But different isotopes, really generally,
have different magnetic moments, or different quadrupolar
deformations.
So what I discussed about hyperfine structure also
applies to isotopes.
I only separated it because usually when
you don't have isotopes, you don't talk about-- like sodium.
Who has ever talked about the mass shift or volume
effect in sodium?
Usually, you don't because sodium
has 100% natural abundance in sodium-23.
So therefore, the hyperfine effects,
they lead to observable splittings even
if you have only one isotope.
But in general, yes, different isotopes
differ in all four effects, the mass effect, the volume effect,
the deformation effect, and the magnetic moment effect.
But the [INAUDIBLE] mass and volume effects
are used more than [INAUDIBLE]?
Because [INAUDIBLE] something different, right,
for different isotopes.

In the start of the lecture, you were
talking about adding [INAUDIBLE] to the other particles.
That will change.
So you would look at that in two different states.
Oh, yeah.
This would change.
But you can separate those effects
because I mentioned that in hyperfine structure,
the center of mass of the energy levels is the same.
So if you see a splitting but take the center for mass,
then the center of ass will only depend on volume and mass
